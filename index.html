            <div><p>My name is Andrew Thurman. I am a current student at Brigham Young University-Idaho.

                <p>I enjoy out door activities such as camping, canoeing, shooting, etc.

                    I am currently working on my own app for those that like to play Role Playing games.
                    This app is for a RP game called Deatwatch. 
                    It is for people to play with others around the world on their phones instead having to look
                    for people and having to get together face to face to play. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is still alot that needs to be done. I am working on the interface as well
                    as the backend of the app. I am hoping that I can get it working in the next few months.
